# Hello

Simple python script to download gifs from giphy given a `search_term`.

# Installation

You just need an api key for giphy. So first got the developer page, make an app, and get your key. Then make a `keys.py` file, and inside of it make a `YOUR_API_KEY` variable and set it to your key. Environment variables maybe in the future...

# Usage

From any directory run 
```bash
python3 searchgifs.py 'search_term' limit
```

The script will create a folder named `search_term` and put the gifs in there.git
